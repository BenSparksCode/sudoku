Project Goals:
 - Primary Goal (COMPLETE): Learn modern React features, Context and Hooks, by using them in place of Redux.
 - Secondary Goal (COMPLETE): Practice algorithm implementation by implementing the recursive Backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles. 


Professionally, I have worked on large scale React projects using Redux to manage state. With the addition of Context and Hooks to React, the combination of these features should replace Redux for most use cases.
