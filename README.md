## A simple Sudoku Game and Puzzle Solver

Tech Stack:
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - JavaScript
 - React (including Hooks and Context)


Project Goals:
 - Primary Goal (COMPLETE): Learn modern React features, Hooks and Context, by using instead of Redux.
 - Secondary Goal (COMPLETE): Practice advanced algorithm implementation by implementing a Sudoku Solver using the Backtracking algorithm.


Professionally, I have worked on large scale React projects using Redux to manage state. With the addition of Hooks and Context, the combination of these features should replace Redux for most intents and purposes.
